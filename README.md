# NYSE-Stock-Interpreter
A simple program to speed up utilization of data drawn from the NYSE's trading data

Requires sanitized data sets. Reads in two column input data in the form of year/volume and returns daily averages per year.
Can be used for an arbitrary number of files. Files are demarcated by NaN in the output file. This is a feature.
Honest.
